## Overview
### Summary
The content of the project itself is epic in terms of it's value. So much valuable information about JavaScript is found here, although I already know most of it. Building the project itself, on the other hand, is challenging in terms of volume, as there's so much content and making it all work semantic-wise was quite taxing.

### The Challenge
- Perfectly mimic the sample page from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL)
- Make sure to follow the user stories dictated by freeCodeCamp
- Build it while ensuring accessibility and responsive-ness

## My process
### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS5
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This project is great as I used it primarily as a typing exercise. It's also great in forcing me to think in terms of hierarchies. There's so much content and room for error but yeah I made it work. 

I thought about building the HTML with JavaScript builders with the data in variables but yeah I recognize that the challenge is supposed to be just HTML and CSS (although I chose to use SASS because cmon). Other than this, there isn't any truly challenging parts to this project.

### Continued development
Perhaps the best thing that I picked up on this project is being mindful of the hierarchies and making sure everything works semantic-wise. Besides this, the styling isn't really a challenge. Only the HTML was taxing.

## Acknowledgments
I keep thinking and there isn't really anyone to thank in this project. I guess I'm just thankful that my keyboard is great lol.
